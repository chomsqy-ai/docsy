Strictly speaking chomsQy AI doesn't work with simulated quantum "neural networks," rather with simulated "parameterized quantum circuits." Whereas classical computers use bits as the basic unit of information, quantum computers use the "qubit," a quantum state based method of encoding information. Though there are problems that will always be clasically simulable the hybrid approach is worth exploring.

## So whatâ€™s quantum-classical NLP?
The current state of the art in quantum computing is the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer, and as those improve, there will be an opportunity to incorporate quantum data, faster processing, increased dimensionality, and other interesting things.
