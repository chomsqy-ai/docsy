chomsQy AI uses simulated quantum circuits, aka "hybrid quantum-classical neural networks" to bring the innovations and improvements of quantum computing algorithms to classical computing, currently through speech recognition and transcription. The goal is to create significant gains and improve accuracy for this core NLP task through minimizing computing cost and resources.
